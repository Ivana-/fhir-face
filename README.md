# fhir-face

Universal frontend view to any sansara fhir server

## Overview

This application allows simple full-text search, CRUD and possible pretty view
for any fhir resource, containing in choosen sansara fhir server.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at `http://localhost:3449/?base-url=<url-of-your-sansara-fhir-server>#/resource`

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
